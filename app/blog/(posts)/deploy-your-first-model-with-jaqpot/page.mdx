After introducing ourselves in our first post, many of you asked for a practical guide to get started with Jaqpot. This post shows you how to deploy your first machine learning model in just a few minutes.

## Why deploy with Jaqpot?

Machine learning deployment often involves complex infrastructure setup, container management, and ongoing maintenance. We built Jaqpot to handle all of this for you. You focus on your model, we handle the rest.

## What You Need

Before we start, make sure you have:
- A trained machine learning model (we support scikit-learn, PyTorch, and more)
- Python installed on your computer
- Basic familiarity with Python programming

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Install the Package

First, install our Python package:

```python
pip install jaqpotpy
```

### 2. Prepare Your Model

Here's a simple example using a scikit-learn model:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
import pandas as pd

# Train your model
model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### 3. Deploy to Jaqpot

Now for the interesting part. Deploy your model with just three lines of code:

```python
from jaqpotpy import Jaqpot

# Initialize Jaqpot
jaq = Jaqpot()

# Upload your model
deployment = jaq.upload_model(
    model=model,
    name="my-first-model",
    description="A regression model for property prediction"
)
```

### 4. Use Your Model

Your model now has its own API endpoint. Use it like this:

```python
# Make predictions
predictions = jaq.predict(
    model_id=deployment.id,
    input_data=your_data
)
```

## What's Next?

Your deployed model is now:
- Available 24/7 through a REST API
- Automatically scaled based on usage
- Protected with authentication
- Monitored for performance

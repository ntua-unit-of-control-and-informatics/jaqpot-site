How Jaqpot Automates Hazard Assessment Reports for Safe and Sustainable by Design (SSbD)

## **Introduction:**

In the era of the European Green Deal, the push toward safer and more sustainable chemicals and materials is stronger than ever. The **Safe and Sustainable by Design (SSbD)** framework demands robust, transparent, and efficient assessment methods. **Jaqpot**, our cloud-based modelling platform, is uniquely positioned to meet this challenge. By integrating state-of-the-art predictive models with an intuitive interface and automation capabilities, Jaqpot can generate complete hazard assessment reports that support SSbD decision-making from early design stages.

## **1\. What is Jaqpot?**

Jaqpot is a web-based platform for deploying, sharing, and running predictive models for chemical, biological, nanomaterial, and environmental safety. It is **modular**, **API-driven**, and **compliant with FAIR principles**. Jaqpot offers both **pre-trained models** and the ability to deploy **custom models** using machine learning or mechanistic approaches.

## **2\. The Role of Hazard Assessment in SSbD**

Under the SSbD framework, a complete hazard assessment is a cornerstone of chemical safety. It typically includes:

* Physicochemical properties (e.g., water solubility, boiling point)

* Environmental fate (e.g., bioaccumulation, persistence)

* Human health endpoints (e.g., mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity)

* Ecotoxicity (e.g., Daphnia or algae toxicity)

These properties are evaluated ideally using validated, reproducible, and explainable **in silico models**—exactly what Jaqpot offers.

## **3\. How Jaqpot Automates the Process**

Jaqpot supports SSbD hazard assessment through:

### **✅ Batch Predictions for multiple hazard indicators**

The user just needs to enter a  SMILES string into a colab notebook and define the hazard indicators of interest.

### **✅ Endpoint Coverage with QSAR and Read-Across**

Jaqpot integrates QSAR models and read-across methods that cover REACH-relevant endpoints, many of which are compliant with OECD principles (such as the QSAR toolbox).

### **✅ Automatic Generation of Molecular Descriptors**

Molecular descriptors and fingerprints are generated automatically through the platform, requiring no manual preprocessing.

### **✅ Integrated Report Generation**

Jaqpot produces **complete, downloadable hazard reports** including:

* Predictions

* Applicability domain checks

* Algorithm explanations

* Model documentation

* Metadata for regulatory transparency

### **✅ Workflow Automation and APIs**

Users can create workflows or connect Jaqpot to other platforms using its **RESTful APIs**. This is ideal for integration into LCA tools, or decision-support systems.

### **✅ Critical information for Digital Product Passports (DPP)**

Jaqpot delivers predictive insights and standardized data outputs that integrate effortlessly into Digital Product Passports (DPPs), enriching them with critical safety and sustainability information.

## **5\. Supporting FAIR, Transparent, and Reproducible SSbD**

Jaqpot ensures:

* **FAIRness**: All model metadata are findable and accessible.

* **Transparency**: Models include documentation, AD analysis, and algorithm description.

* **Reproducibility**: The same inputs always return the same results thanks to controlled pipelines.

## **6\. Future Directions: Integration with LCA, PBK, and AOP Models**

The next generation of the workflow will include feeding into **Life Cycle Impact Assessment** tools to close the SSbD loop.

# Docker models on Jaqpot

Jaqpot supports deploying custom models using Docker containers. This lets you run any model, regardless of its framework or dependencies, as long as you package it correctly.

### Important note about deployment

The deployment process for Docker models is manually managed by our team to ensure security and proper integration. Before deployment:

1. Contact us at upci.ntua@gmail.com with your model details
2. We will review your requirements and provide specific instructions
3. Once approved, we will help you integrate your model into our infrastructure

### How it works:

1. Create a model configuration with Docker settings
2. Implement your model using our template
3. Build and test your Docker image locally
4. Contact us for deployment review and instructions
5. After approval, we'll host your model on Jaqpot

The following sections will guide you through the technical implementation. Remember to reach out to us before starting the deployment process.

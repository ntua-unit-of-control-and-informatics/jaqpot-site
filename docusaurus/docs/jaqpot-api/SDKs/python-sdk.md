```python
from jaqpotpy.api.jaqpot_api_client import JaqpotApiClient
jaqpot = JaqpotApiClient()
```

## Retrieve a model by ID

To retrieve a model by its ID, you can use the `get_model_by_id` method. Here is an example:

```python
model = jaqpot.get_model_by_id(model_id=1860)
print(model)
```

## Get shared models with organizations

To get the models that you share with Jaqpot organizations, you can use the `get_shared_models` method. Here is an example:

```python
shared_models = jaqpot.get_shared_models()
print(shared_models)
```

## Synchronous prediction

To take a synchronous prediction with a model, you can use the `predict_sync` method. In synchronous prediction, the http call waits until the prediction is complete before moving on. This is useful for quick predictions where you need an immediate result. Use the predict_sync method as shown below:

```python
input_data = [{"SMILES": "CC", "X1": 1, "X2": 2, "Cat_col": "CAT_1"}]
prediction = jaqpot.predict_sync(model_id=1853, dataset=input_data)
print(prediction)
```

In this case, the program will wait until predict_sync returns the prediction results, which are then printed.

## Asynchronous prediction

To take an asynchronous prediction with a model, you can use the `predict_async` method. In asynchronous prediction, the http call doesnâ€™t wait for the prediction to finish, allowing it to continue running other tasks. This is useful for longer predictions or when handling multiple requests. Use the predict_async method as follows:

```python
input_data = [{"SMILES": "CC", "X1": 1, "X2": 2}]
prediction_dataset_id = jaqpot.predict_async(model_id=1812, dataset=input_data)
```

## Get a dataset by ID

To retrieve a dataset by its ID, you can use the `get_dataset_by_id` method. Here is an example:

```python
results = jaqpot.get_dataset_by_id(dataset_id=prediction_dataset_id)
print(results)
```

## Prediction with a model and a CSV File

To take a prediction with a model using a CSV file, you can use the `predict_with_csv_sync` method. Here is an example:

```python
csv_path = "ADD_A_CSV_PATH.csv"
prediction = jaqpot.predict_with_csv_sync(model_id=1812, csv_path=csv_path)
print(prediction)
```

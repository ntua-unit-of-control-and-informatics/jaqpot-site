# Jaqpot API
The Jaqpot API is a service that handles model management, deployment and predictions. It receives models through its endpoints, manages them, and can run predictions for them via the API.

### Key Features:

- **Model Storage**: Store and version your machine learning models
- **Deployment:** Deploy models for production use
- **Predictions:** Get predictions through HTTP endpoints
- **User Management**: Handle users, organizations and model sharing
- **SDKs**: Use our Python SDK (jaqpotpy) to interact with the API - more SDKs coming soon

We maintain SDKs to help you use the API directly in your code. Currently available in Python, with more languages planned.

# Jaqpotpy

Jaqpotpy is a comprehensive Python library that serves as both a model development toolkit and client SDK for the Jaqpot platform. It streamlines the entire machine learning workflow, from model creation to deployment and inference.
### Key Features

- **Model Development**: Build and train machine learning models with integrated preprocessing, featurization, and evaluation capabilities
- **Model Management**: Seamlessly upload and manage your trained models on the Jaqpot platform
- **Enhanced ML Pipeline**: Incorporate custom featurizers, preprocessing steps, and performance metrics
- **Platform Integration**: Act as a client SDK to interact with Jaqpot API for model deployment and predictions
- **Production-Ready**: Prepare models for production deployment with standardized preprocessing and evaluation

Jaqpotpy bridges the gap between local model development and production deployment, ensuring consistent model behavior across environments while providing tools to enhance model quality and performance.

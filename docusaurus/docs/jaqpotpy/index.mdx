- **Upload Models**: Upload your trained models to Jaqpot
- **Custom Tools**: Add your own preprocessing steps, featurization and metrics
- **Use Jaqpot**: Connect to Jaqpot API to deploy models and get predictions
- **Deploy**: Get your models ready for production use
- **Offline Predictions** ðŸ†•: Download models and run predictions locally without internet

Jaqpotpy helps you take your models from your computer to the Jaqpot platform, where others can use them. With the new offline capabilities, you can also bring Jaqpot models back to your local environment for private, fast predictions.

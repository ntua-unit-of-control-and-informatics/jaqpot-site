# Examples

## GitHub Examples
Find a comprehensive collection of usage examples in our main repository: https://github.com/ntua-unit-of-control-and-informatics/jaqpotpy/tree/main/examples

## Google Colab Examples
For interactive, runnable examples, check out our Google Colab repository: https://github.com/ntua-unit-of-control-and-informatics/jaqpot-google-colab-examples

These Colab notebooks provide step-by-step tutorials and practical demonstrations of Jaqpotpy features in an interactive environment. You can run the examples directly in your browser without any local setup, making it perfect for quick experimentation and learning.

## Offline Model Examples ðŸ†•

For offline model usage examples, check out:
- [Offline Models Documentation](./offline-models.md) - Complete guide with examples
- [GitHub Examples](https://github.com/ntua-unit-of-control-and-informatics/jaqpotpy/tree/main/examples) - Look for offline prediction examples
- [Google Colab Examples](https://github.com/ntua-unit-of-control-and-informatics/jaqpot-google-colab-examples) - Interactive offline model tutorials

The offline examples demonstrate how to:
- Download models for local use
- Run predictions without internet connectivity
- Handle different model types (SKLEARN_ONNX, TORCH_ONNX, TORCH_GEOMETRIC_ONNX, etc.)
- Process molecular data with SMILES strings
- Batch process large datasets locally
